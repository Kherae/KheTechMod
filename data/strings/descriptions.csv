khe_warped_omega_core,RESOURCE,"This...core, if you can call it that, resembles the imagined drawings of an Omega Core at first, however it is different in many disturbing ways. Chief among them is a deep, intense desire to erase all life that enters the minds of anyone who approaches it. This, in addition to the unceasing stream of unintelligible whispers coming seemingly from nowhere, is enough of a warning that whatever mind occupies it is overtly hostile and very dangerous.",,,,,
kheacausaldisruptor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly overloads a nearby enemy ship, usable while phased but will force an exit from phase space with twice the normal cooldown. If used against a phased ship, they are overloaded three times as long.

It also discharges hardflux when exiting phase space.",Special,"Moves ship into phase space, like normal phase ships. On exiting, hardflux discharge with longer cooldown and increased flux dissipation.",,,
khe_vanguard,SHIP,"A Vanguard, probably stolen from pirates, that has been heavily modified with experimental hardware and had an ugly splotch of blue paint added. Somehow it still holds together, if only just barely.",Ugly Metal Mass,"A very badly painted Vanguard, with who knows what other modifications.",,,
