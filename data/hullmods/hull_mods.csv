Passive Venting Hack,kheventhack,2,,KHM,"special, offensive, merc",Special,15000,,,,5,10,15,20,kheTechMod.combat.hullmods.VentHack,"Considered an offensive hack against a captain’s own ship, and recommended only slightly more than Safety Overrides, this modification replaces standard capacitors and active venting systems in favor of experimental, high-throughput hardware.
The new systems are incompatible with ships equipped with phase or shield systems, and the new capacitors are volatile and burn out quickly.","Disables venting, reduces flux capacity, increases flux dissipation.",,graphics/hullmods/shared_flux_sink.png
