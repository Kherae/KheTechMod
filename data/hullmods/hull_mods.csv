Passive Venting Hack,kheventhack,2,,KHM,"special, offensive, merc",Special,15000,,,,5,10,15,20,kheTechMod.combat.hullmods.VentHack,"Considered an offensive hack against a captain’s own ship, and recommended only slightly more than Safety Overrides, this modification replaces standard capacitors and active venting systems in favor of experimental, high-throughput hardware.
Flux dissipation is increased by %s, scaling with non-zero vent rate modifiers, but flux capacity is reduced by %s. However, the new systems are incompatible with ships equipped with phase or shield systems, and the new capacitors burn out quickly requiring %s supplies per month to keep the ship from burning out. Further, the Zero-Flux speed boost is out of the question, unless you want to lose your ship’s power systems entirely.","Disables venting, reduces flux capacity, increases flux dissipation.",,graphics/hullmods/shared_flux_sink.png
